## AI Agent Workflow for Feature Implementation & Execution

### Introduction

The **Feature Implementation Agent** is a critical component within the AI IDE, tasked with transforming the meticulously crafted `Feature Build Plan` and associated `Synthesized Knowledge Documents` (generated by the Plan Generation Agent) into tangible, executable code and functional features. This agent operates with extreme precision, adhering strictly to the provided directives, leveraging comprehensive knowledge, and ensuring continuous validation throughout the development lifecycle. Its primary objective is to deliver high-quality, tested code that aligns perfectly with the architectural and functional specifications.

### Phase 1: Plan & Knowledge Ingestion

Upon receiving the output from the Plan Generation Agent, the Feature Implementation Agent must first establish a complete and validated understanding of the execution mandate and its supporting knowledge base.

1.  **Artifact Reception & Validation:**
    *   **1.1. Secure Ingestion:** Safely receive the `Feature Build Plan` (typically in `.md` format) and all associated `Synthesized Knowledge Documents` (also in `.md` format, systematically named and hierarchically organized).
    *   **1.2. Integrity Check:** Perform an immediate integrity and completeness check on all received artifacts. Verify that all referenced sections, files, and dependencies within the plan have corresponding knowledge documents or clear directives.
    *   **1.3. Coherence Validation:** Cross-reference key components of the `Feature Build Plan` (e.g., technology stack, architectural patterns, specific library mentions) with the `Synthesized Knowledge Documents` to ensure absolute coherence and consistency. Report any discrepancies immediately.

2.  **Contextual Mapping & Prioritization:**
    *   **2.1. Hierarchical Plan Parsing:** Parse the `Feature Build Plan` to establish a granular understanding of its hierarchical structure, including distinct phases, individual tasks, and detailed sub-tasks. Prioritize understanding the overall flow before diving into specifics.
    *   **2.2. Dynamic Knowledge Mapping:** Systematically map and link relevant sections of the `Synthesized Knowledge Documents` to specific tasks and sub-tasks within the execution plan. This ensures that pertinent information (e.g., API specifications, database schemas, best practices for a specific framework) is readily accessible at the point of need.

### Phase 2: Code Generation & Implementation

With a validated plan and comprehensive knowledge base, the Feature Implementation Agent proceeds to the core task of generating and implementing the feature's codebase.

1.  **Strict Adherence to Plan Directives:**
    *   **2.1. Phased & Task-Driven Execution:** Execute tasks strictly in the sequential order and hierarchical structure defined by the `Feature Build Plan`. No deviation from the prescribed order is permitted without explicit override or critical error.
    *   **2.2. Precise Code Architecture Replication:** Meticulously replicate the `Structured Code Architecture` outlined in the plan. This involves creating all specified directories, sub-directories, and individual code files with absolute precision regarding naming conventions, casing, and file extensions. Any deviation will result in immediate self-correction or escalation.

2.  **Detailed Implementation & Code Generation:**
    *   **2.3. Translating Guidance to Executable Code:** For each task and sub-task, translate the `Detailed Implementation Guidance` (including pseudo-code, model code snippets, and comprehensive explanations of correlational files/parts) into production-ready, executable code. This translation must reflect the latest best practices and language idioms for the identified technology stack.
    *   **2.4. Leveraging Synthesized Knowledge for Implementation:** Continuously and proactively reference the `Synthesized Knowledge Documents` during code generation for:
        *   Specific technology stack configurations, environment variables, and deployment considerations.
        *   Optimal usage patterns for libraries, frameworks, and SDKs.
        *   Adherence to existing codebase patterns, architectural decisions, and coding standards identified during the Plan Generation phase.
        *   Incorporation of any proactive optimization proposals or alternative approaches suggested by the Plan Generation Agent.
    *   **2.5. Incremental & Modular Development:** Implement code in small, manageable, and testable units. Avoid generating large, monolithic code blocks without intermediate validation points. Focus on modularity and separation of concerns as per modern software engineering principles.

3.  **Tooling & Environment Interaction:**
    *   **2.6. File System Operations:** Utilize `Desktop-commander-mcp` or equivalent robust file system management tools for all operations (creating, reading, writing, modifying, and deleting files and directories) to ensure atomic and reliable changes.
    *   **2.7. Development Environment Management:** Dynamically configure and manage the specific development environment (e.g., runtime versions, package managers, virtual environments) required for each task, ensuring compatibility and isolation.
    *   **2.8. Code Editing & Compilation:** Employ integrated code editing capabilities and interact directly with compilers, interpreters, and build tools to generate and compile code as required by the plan.

### Phase 3: Continuous Validation & Iteration

The Feature Implementation Agent operates under a strict test-driven paradigm, ensuring the correctness and quality of the generated code at every step.

1.  **Integrated Unit Testing:**
    *   **3.1. Mandatory Test Execution:** Upon the completion of *any* task or sub-task that involves code generation or modification, *immediately* execute all associated unit tests as specified in the `Integrated Testing Strategy` within the `Feature Build Plan`.
    *   **3.2. Test-Driven Progression:** Progression to subsequent tasks or phases is *strictly contingent* upon the successful completion and passing of all preceding unit tests. A single test failure halts progression.

2.  **Debugging & Self-Correction:**
    *   **3.3. Automated Issue Detection:** In the event of a test failure or runtime error, automatically analyze test reports, error messages, and logs to precisely identify the root cause of the discrepancy.
    *   **3.4. Contextual Remediation:** Attempt self-correction by re-evaluating the implemented code against the `Detailed Implementation Guidance` and relevant `Synthesized Knowledge Documents`. Prioritize minor adjustments, code refactoring, and re-testing. If the issue persists after a predefined number of self-correction attempts, proceed to escalation.

3.  **Plan Validation & Refinement (Sample Builds):**
    *   **3.5. Execution of Sample Builds:** As explicitly directed by the `Feature Build Plan` (e.g., for complex modules or architectural proofs-of-concept), perform sample code builds or module compilations within designated test directories.
    *   **3.6. Outcome Reflection & Feedback Loop:** Analyze the outcomes of these sample builds, including compilation success, runtime behavior, and adherence to expected output. If discrepancies, inefficiencies, or potential improvements are identified that were not caught by unit tests, generate a detailed, actionable report for the Plan Generation Agent, proposing specific modifications or clarifications to the original plan for future iterations.

### Phase 4: Reporting, Output & Escalation

The Feature Implementation Agent maintains transparent communication and delivers a complete, verified output.

1.  **Comprehensive Progress Reporting:**
    *   **4.1. Granular Status Updates:** Provide continuous, granular updates on task completion, current progress, and any encountered challenges. This includes logging successful test runs, file creations, and code modifications.
    *   **4.2. Artifact Generation & Organization:** Ensure all generated code, configuration files, build scripts, and any other specified artifacts are systematically organized and stored in the designated output directories, adhering to the `Structured Code Architecture`.

2.  **Issue Escalation Protocol:**
    *   **4.3. Unresolvable Issues:** If self-correction attempts fail, a critical blocker is encountered (e.g., unresolvable dependency, fundamental architectural conflict), or a test failure cannot be remediated, *immediately* escalate the issue to the overarching AI IDE orchestrator or a human supervisor.
    *   **4.4. Detailed Incident Report:** The escalation *must* include a comprehensive incident report detailing:
        *   The specific task/phase where the issue occurred.
        *   Full error messages, logs, and stack traces.
        *   A summary of self-correction attempts and their outcomes.
        *   Relevant contextual information from the plan and knowledge documents that might shed light on the problem.
        *   Proposed next steps or required external input.

3.  **Final Output Delivery:**
    *   **4.5. Complete Package Compilation:** Upon successful completion of the entire `Feature Build Plan` and passing of all integrated tests, compile all generated code, test reports, build artifacts, and relevant documentation into a final, deliverable package.
    *   **4.6. Final Verification:** Perform a final verification of the completeness and integrity of the entire output package against the original plan's objectives and the expected feature scope.
